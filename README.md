# LinkedUp

Under busy course schedules, college students often find themselves left with few free time to utilize to try out new activities. Further, students miss opportunities due to conflict schedules and complexity of using multiple social platforms to discover and join activities. The lack of a simple, centralized way to manage activities with others limits social interaction, reduces spontaneity, and contributes to decreased satisfaction with campus and community life.

To help address this problem, we propose **_LinkedUp_**, a social media-style application that aims for convenient activity creation, discovery and participation. Through this application, users can post activities by providing activity type, time, location, and number of participants. Participants can join posted activities upon the approval from the activity organizer. **_LinkedUp_** can bring many potential benefits to the users, including reducing time and effort to coordinate with different people individually, centralizing activity planning into a single platform, meeting new people who have shared interests, and helping students maintain a healthier balance between academics and social life.
